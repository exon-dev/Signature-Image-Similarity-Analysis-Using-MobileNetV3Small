# Signature Image Similarity Analysis Using MobileNetV3Small

## Overview

This repository provides a solution for analyzing the similarity between signature images using the MobileNetV3Small model. The project demonstrates how to preprocess signature images, extract features using a pre-trained MobileNetV3Small model, and compare the similarity between images based on their feature vectors.

## Features

- **Feature Extraction**: Uses the MobileNetV3Small model to extract features from signature images.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizes, normalizes, and prepares images for feature extraction.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Computes similarity between two signature images using cosine similarity.
- **Model Management**: Saves and loads the MobileNetV3Small model.
